# Portfolio App
<img src="logo.png" width="50px" height="50px" alt="Logo">


My iOS application that is written entirely in Swift and built using UiKit.

## Features

### Custom Images
I created custom icons and images for (almost) everything you see using a combination of:
- Adobe Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator
- Sketch
- SF Symbols

### 2048
- A 2048 Clone.
- Adaptation of austinzhend's 2048
https://github.com/austinzheng/swift-2048.
- Added leaderboard functionality with persistent local data showing top 5 scores via CoreData.
- Modified GameBoard and Scenes to fit any device resolution

### Work Hour Tracker
- Keeps track of work hours.
- Data is stored/retrieved with CoreData.
- Date/Time picker in case of retroactive input.

### Prank Loading Screen
- Created as a joke for friends
- Initially the dramatically long loading screen was to be viewed when you first opened the app,
with an option to disable the process altogether in settings (which I did implement). But I later
decided to move it to an optional home-screen button that opens modally.

### Settings
- Toggle for Dark Mode/Light Mode
- Toggle to disable background particle animation (Improves performance on older devices with less powerful processors)
